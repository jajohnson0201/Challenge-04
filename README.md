# Description
The goal with this project was to start with nothing and create a game, for proof of knowing how to do it and have a tool for actually studying coding! had to start with barebones HTML,CSS,Javascript files and create a funtional game with tools we learned in class!
The only tools available were past lectures and resources and (extensive) help from the Teacher, TA's, and also classmates were a huge help! I also had help from a tutor with this project to smooth out the rough edges I was facing.
The reason for making this project was to challenge what I can create within javascript, CSS and HTML, and make them all work together fluidly... Other than it being a challenge it was a great learning experience which resembled what i'm likely to see in the working world!
I learned with this project that there are multiple ways to make similar things happen, this slightly complicates things, but it also is great knowing theres not one set way of doing everything with coding. This challenge was great practice, and something for sure to look back on!

# Credits
Teacher and TA were very helpful! Classmates also had similar questions that helped!
